# TS_ENGINE
This is a simple graphics engine which I have been developing since a while to show graphics demos on my youtube channel.

Steps to use TS_ENGINE:
1. Run Install vcpkg is vcpkg is not installed on your system.
2. Run GenerateVS2019Project or GenerateVS2022Project to generate project files.
3. [Optional] You can run RemoveInstalledPackage incase you need to delete the installed packages.

You can find the project under build folder after that.
